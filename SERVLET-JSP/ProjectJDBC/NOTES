Project objective: 
As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts.

● Set up a master list of all the classes

● Assign classes for subjects from the master list
● Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
● Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)
     
There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class,
