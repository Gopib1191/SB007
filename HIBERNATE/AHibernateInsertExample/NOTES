sir, how do we write a code for a null table to add first data automatically
 and keep inserting the next entries?
 
 When you run your code first Time Configuration  should be [Dev Configuration ]
<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>

ANd From Next Time Onwards : [Production COnfiguration]
 <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>
