sir, but what is the need of creating POJO class?
Why we make POJO


We see what we need to do in steps, but the question is why we do that



Hibernate is Persistance Framework 


HIBERNATE 
	1. XML Configuration 
	2. Annotation Configuration
	
Steps to Create the Hibernate Project ?

1. Create the JAVA Project .
2. Create the /lib folder .
3. Place the required JAR's file in to /lib folder .
4. Select all the JAR's and add in to build path. 
5. Place the "hibernate.cfg.xml" in to /src folder .
	Know more - https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html
6. Create the POJO Class
7. Place the "*.hbm.xml" file in to the package where POJO classes are there.
	7.1 What is the name of hbm file <POJO-FILE-NAME>.hbm.xml
	7.2 *.hbm.xml and POJO class should be in same package.


In Hibernate type="string" is optional.

JDBC:
Create the table 

JDBC is not able to CREATE The table it self -True or false







POJO CLASS
	

ENTITY CLASS
	POJO + hbm file


<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>
	1. It drop the Existing table if exist,  Table details -> *.hbm file
	2. Create the New table with the name as *.hbm file
